# Super_Store_ETL_Pipeline


## About Project 
This project centres around the efficient handling and transformation of data. Specifically, we're tasked with the comprehensive upload of Superstore data into Snowflake, implementing an ETL pipeline in IICS (Informatica intelligent cloud services) for data refinement, and structuring the data into three fundamental components: location dimension table, date dimension table, and a fact table and developing a user-friendly Power BI dashboard that empowers data visualization and presentation. In an age where data insights drive crucial decision-making, our endeavour serves to provide a streamlined, accessible, and insightful approach to data management.
